# FYS-STK4155: Project 3
In this project, we have analyzed the Wisconsin Breast Cancer data by application of different machine learning algorithms to see what method performed best for optimal classification of breast cancer diagnosis. We wanted to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based upon different features. We included the classification algorithms of Neural Network, Decision Trees, and Decision Trees with added bagging (Random Forest) and boosting (AdaBoost).

Please see the project report for all additional information about our project.
