# FYS-STK4155: Project 2
In this project we wanted to explore if there is any difference of classification accuracy between the two datamining techniques logistic regressionand neural network, and wheter or not the estimated probability of default produced from data mining represent the real probability ofdefault. In order to answer these questions, we have estimated precision scores on the two different methods, and lookedon how well the models classifies on behalf of the confusion matrix.

Please see the project report for all additional information about our project.
